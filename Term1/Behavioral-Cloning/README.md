| `model.py`                   | Convolutional Neural Network Pipeline                                   |
| `model.h5`                   | Trained model to predict steering wheel angle - Generated by `model.py` |
| `drive.py`                   | Drive the car using `model.h5` to predict the steering wheel angle      |

## Dataset Structure
In simulator, there are 3 cameras attached to the car. These are the images taken by each camera:

| Postion | Size | Dimension | Color |
|---------|------|-----------|-------|
|  Left   | ~16K |  160x320  |  RGB  |
|  Center | ~16K |  160x320  |  RGB  |
|  Right  | ~16K |  160x320  |  RGB  |
|  **Total** | **~50k** |  **160x320**  |  **RGB**  |

> To get this amount of data, It takes about 30min of driving around the track.

## Training Strategy

### Augmentation
To get more data and get rid of the bias in turning left because almost all the turns during the driving session are turning to the left, we flipped the images verticaly then multiply the each sterring wheel angle for flipped images by `-1`

```python

measurments = read_csv('data/driving_log.csv', usecols=[3]).values
C = measurments
L = measurments + 0.2
R = measurments - 0.2
measurments = np.concatenate((C, L, R, -C, -L, -R), axis=0)

```
> This operation produce ~150k of images.

### How Camera and Steering Wheel Work
Each image taken has its own steering wheel angle which will act as a result of the neural network. This image demonstrates the process.
