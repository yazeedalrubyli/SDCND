# PID Controller
## P, I, D Effect
The P, or "proportional", component had the most directly observable effect on the car's behavior. It causes the car to steer proportional (and opposite) to the car's distance from the lane center (which is the CTE) - if the car is far to the right it steers hard to the left, if it's slightly to the left it steers slightly to the right.

The D, or "differential", component counteracts the P component's tendency to ring and overshoot the center line. A properly tuned D parameter will cause the car to approach the center line smoothly without ringing.

The I, or "integral", component counteracts a bias in the CTE which prevents the P-D controller from reaching the center line. This bias can take several forms, such as a steering drift (as in the Control unit lessons), but I believe that in this particular implementation the I component particularly serves to reduce the CTE around curves.

## Hyperparameters
Hyperparameters were chosen manually after couple attempts and the car was smoothly moving around the track. We can extend the project further by implementing the Twiddle algorithm to automate parameter optimization.
